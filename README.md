Things that need to be added 

Building a UI with Fragments [recommended]
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/index.html
Access and follow the Building a Dynamic UI with Fragments tutorial at the above URL.  As you work 
through the tutorial remember that your app only needs to support API level 21 and higher, so 
factor that in when the tutorial offers different approaches to provide compatibility for older 
devices.


Consolidation [required]
Write a paragraph to explain the purpose of and differences between Android Activities, Intents, and 
Fragments.  Have your answer checked and discussed with your tutor.
